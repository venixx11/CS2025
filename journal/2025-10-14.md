# 2025-10-14 â€” Day 0 Journal

## What I Did Today
- Set up CS2025 repo structure
- Configured .gitignore for Python
- Prepared folders for macOS, Linux, projects, and journal
- Created a Python script to convert decimal <-> binary
- Observed how bin() works
- Learned about [2:] slicing and int(..., 2)

## What you learned / noticed
- Computers store numbers in base 2
- Python provides helper functions (bin() and int(..., base))
- How to manually inspect binary digits with loops or arithmetic

## Questions / next experiments
- How are negative numbers represented in binary?
- How does Python store very large numbers?
- Can I multiply or add binary numbers directly?

## Notes
- Repo is now ready for dual-system workflow
- Will push daily progress from both Mac and Ubuntu
